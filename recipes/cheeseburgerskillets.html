    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Cheeseburger Skillets have all of the components of a cheeseburger meal (minus the bread) mixed up in a skillet to make for an awesome meal prep dish. They are made up of a ground beef, roasted potatoes, onions, kale, pickles, and cheese.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 medium (750 g) russet potatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 lbs (908 g) ground beef (90/10)</li>
        <li>1 bunch (125 g) kale</li>
        <li>1 small (125 g) red onion</li>
        <li>2 spears (50 g) dill pickles</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (8 g) garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ cup (50 g) shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>10 tbsp (150 g) ketchup</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F. Place your sheet pan inside while it preheats.</li>
        <li>Wash and cut your potatoes into a large dice. I cut mine into quarter moons of about 5mm thick.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to a large bowl with 1 tbsp of oil and salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Spray the sheet pan lightly with oil and spread the potatoes out evenly. Roast for 10-12 minutes then flip the potatoes to the other side and continue cooking for an additional 8-10 minutes or until they have browned to your liking.</li>
        <li>Cut your onion into thin slices from root to shoot.</li>
        <li>Wash and remove the kale leaves from the stems. Roughly chop the kale into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Massage the chopped kale for a few minutes by squeezing it in your hands. This will soften it and make it less bitter. You should be able to feel it getting softer and becoming a darker green color.</li>
        <li>Cut the pickle spears into a small dice.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 tbsp of oil over medium high heat and add in your beef to brown. Spread it out in the bottom of the skillet and allow it to develop color before you break it up.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li>When it is ready to turn, flip it over to the other side and now you can start to break it up.</li>
        <li>When the beef is about 90% of the way finished, move it to the perimeter of your pan and allow the fat to pool in the center. Add the onions to the middle and sprinkle a bit of salt over the top to encourage them to cook faster.</li>
        <li>After a minute or two and the onions have had a chance on the heat, dump the kale into the skillet and season with 1 tbsp of garlic powder. Mix the contents of the skillet together and allow the kale and onions to continue to cook.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes have finished, add them to skillet and mix. Taste test and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>This recipe makes 5 servings. Lay out 5 meal prep containers and divide the contents of the skillet evenly between each dish.</li>
        <li>Create some space in a corner of each dish and place a ramekin inside. Fill each ramekin with 2 tbsp (30g) of ketchup.</li>
        <li>Measure out ½ cup (50g) of cheddar cheese and add 10g to the top of each dish and finish them off with the diced pickles.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>
