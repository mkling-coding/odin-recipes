    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I was able to meal prep this Easy Ground Chicken Curry in only 40 minutes. It is a simplified version of chicken curry to allow for a fast option on weeks where you don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen on Sunday.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs (908 g) ground chicken (97/3)</li>
        <li>1 small (125 g) onion</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 g) ghee or oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (9 g) curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp (3 g) garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp (3 g) paprika</li>
        <li>¼ tsp (1 g) cayenne pepper optional</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) garlic</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) ginger</li>
        <li>15 oz (425 g) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¾ cup (180 g) water</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup (20 g) chopped cilantro optional</li>
        <li>1½ cups (270 g) dry rice</li>
        <li>2½ cups (600 g) water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) ghee or oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp (3 g) cumin</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (15 g) garlic</li>
        <li>1 lb (454 g) frozen peas and carrots</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, add 1 tbsp of ghee or oil over medium high heat. Add 1 tbsp of garlic, 1½ cups dry rice, and 1 tsp of cumin and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Toast the rice in the oil and seasonings for 2-3 minutes or until it starts to take on some color and lightly brown. Once toasted, pour in 2½ cups of water and bring to a boil. Place a tight fitting lid on top and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, thaw the peas and carrots in the microwave.</li>
        <li>After the 15 minutes are up, turn off the heat and allow to rest, covered, for 5 more minutes. Then add the peas and carrots and fluff the rice with a fork. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, prepare the curry. Cut the onion into small dice and roughly chop the cilantro into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of ghee or oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add in the onions, 1 tbsp of garlic, 1 tbsp of ginger, 1 tbsp of curry powder, 1 tsp of garam masala, 1 tsp of paprika, and ¼ tsp of cayenne pepper. Stir around to mix the spices and aromatics together so that the spices can toast in the oil for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add another 1 tbsp of ghee or oil and then place the ground chicken into the skillet. Season lightly with salt and pepper and allow the chicken to brown for a couple of minutes before flipping to the other side and breaking up the meat.</li>
        <li>When the chicken has developed some browning and is about 80% of the way cooked, pour in 1 can of tomato sauce and ¾ cup of water. Reduce the heat to medium and allow the pan to come to a light boil to stew down the tomato and thicken into a sauce. It will take about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the sauce has thickened slightly, taste test the meat and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>This recipe makes 5 servings. Divide the ingredients evenly between your 5 containers. They will last 5 days in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
